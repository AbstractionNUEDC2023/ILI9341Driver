# ILI9341 Driver Library For STM32
## What's this
    This library is a driver library for ILI9341 based on STM32 HAL.  
    Notice that this library only supports FSMC, does not support SPI.And I haven't write code for touch.
## Usage
    Include ILI9341.h and modify ILI9341Cfg.h, then happy coding!  
    Please MAKE SURE that ILI9341Cfg.h has been correctly modified according to your hardware connection.  
    

## Known Issues

1. Draw string strangely veritically mirrored
